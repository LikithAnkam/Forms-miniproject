        <h1>HTML Interview Questions</h1>
        <h3>1.What is HTML ?</h3>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It structures content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. It is a markup language, not a programming language.</p>
        <h3>2.Markup Language vs Programming Language -What is the difference? </h3>
        <p>A markup language like HTML defines the structure and presentation of data. A programming language like JavaScript performs logical operations and computations.</p>
        <h3>3.What is the use of Anchor Tag</h3>
        <p>The <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks that navigate to another webpage or resource.
           Example: <a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a></p>
        <h3>4.What is the box model in CSS?</h3>
        <p>The box model defines how HTML elements are sized and spaced using:</p>
        <p><b>Content :</b> actual text or image</p>
        <p><b>Padding :</b>space around the content</p>
        <p><b>Border :</b>edge around the padding</p>
        <p><b>Margin :</b>space outside the border</p>
        <h3>5.What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) are both languages used to create web pages, but they differ mainly in how strict they are with coding rules. HTML is more flexible and forgiving, meaning browsers can still display a page correctly even if there are small errors like missing tags or unquoted attributes. On the other hand, XHTML is stricter because it follows the rules of XML. In XHTML, all tags must be properly closed, written in lowercase, and all attribute values must be enclosed in double quotes. image is valid in HTML, but in XHTML it must be written as. While both are supported by modern browsers, most developers today prefer using HTML5 because it is simpler and easier to work with, whereas XHTML is usually chosen for systems that require very clean, well-structured code.</p>
